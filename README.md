This is a repo, for deploying JBoss EAP, with JBoss JDG modules.
In this configuration, EAP will be running as the server, and we rely on the external connectors: Hot Rod, Memcached or REST to access the cache from the application.

The software being used here, is from Red Hat and for obvious reasons has not been included. You will need to ensure that a files directory exists, in the roles/<role_being_used> path and place the relevant software therin. Also ensure that you are using your own hosts file.
